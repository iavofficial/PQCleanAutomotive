# PQCleanAutomotive
PQCleanAutomotive is planned as a collection of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for automotive microcontrollers. The post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are based on the [PQClean](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean) repository, which is a clean collection of the [NIST post-quantum project](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography).

## Security Note
There was no security risk analysis like TARA or similar carried out for QuantumSAR. The post-quantum cryptographic algorithms itself were evaluated by NIST.
The required random numbers are calculated using a software solution, which is only intended to serve as an example.

## Content
The base of PQCleanAutomotive is the PQClean repository with the latest commit [#504](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/commit/fb003a2a625c49f3090eec546b2383dcfa2c75d8). It includes the following post-quantum cryptographic algorithms:

* CRYSTALS-KYBER
* CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM
* SPHINCS+
* FALCON

## Implementation
For the integration of PQCleanAutomotive, the file Crypto.c in the IAV quantumSAR repository contains an example of the use of the CRYSTALS-KYBER, CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM, SPHINCS+ and FALCON algorithm.

In the SPHINCS+ algorithm, dynamic arrays had to be replaced by static arrays in various functions for the microcontroller implementation.

## MISRA
PQCleanAutomotive and the post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are checked with the 2012 version of [MISRA](https://misra.org.uk/app/uploads/2021/06/MISRA-C-2012-Permits-First-Edition.pdf). Not all MISRA findings could be resolved. An explanation has been written in the relevant places.
Note: Rule 1.1 of MISRA was globally disabled because the IAV headers in each file are detected as macros, leading to numerous false positives. Disabling this rule ensures that these headers are not incorrectly flagged as violations.

## Doxygen
The post-quantum cryptographic algorithms have been labelled with doxygen comments for documentation reasons.

## Compiler
In this repository the post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are warning free compiled with TASKING Compiler with standard flags.
