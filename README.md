# PQCleanAutomotive
PQCleanAutomotive is planed as a collection of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for automotive microcontrollers. The post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are based on the [PQClean](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean) repository, which is a clean collection of the [NIST post-quantum project](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography).

## Security Note
There was no security risk analysis like TARA or similar carried out for QuantumSAR. The post-quantum cryptographic algorithms itself were evaluated by NIST.
The required random numbers are calculated using a software solution, which is only intended to serve as an example.

## Content
The base of PQCleanAutomotive is the PQClean repository with the latest commit [#504](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/commit/fb003a2a625c49f3090eec546b2383dcfa2c75d8). It includes the following post-quantum cryptographic algorithms:

* CRYSTALS-KYBER
* CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM
* SPHINCS+

The folloing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are in work:

* FALCON

## Implementation
For the integration of PQCleanAutomotive, the file Crypto.c in the IAV quantumSAR repository contains an example of the use of the CRYSTALS-KYBER, CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM and SPHINCS+ algorithm.

The library requires an H-file containing all data types of the respective hardware platform (Platform_Types.h). The implementation from Infineon for the AURIX microcontroller family can be used as an example here: https://github.com/Infineon/AURIX_code_examples/blob/master/code_examples/Blinky_LED_1_KIT_TC397_TFT/Libraries/iLLD/TC39B/Tricore/Cpu/Std/Platform_Types.h

In the SPHINCS+ algorithm, dynamic arrays had to be replaced by static arrays in various functions for the microcontroller implementation.
